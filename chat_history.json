Initially, this can be a static list.\n    *   Modify the Profile screen (`app/(tabs)/profile.tsx`) to include user profile information.\n\n2.  **Implement Upload Functionality:**\n    *   Create a component for uploading images. This component should allow users to select images from their device's photo library.\n    *   Add input fields for the event name and date.\n    *   Implement the romantic frames feature. This could involve overlaying images or using a library for image manipulation.\n\n3.  **Implement Date and Year Display:**\n    *   Ensure that the date and year the photo was taken are displayed clearly on the Home screen.\n    *   Add customization options to change the date format or hide/show the date.\n\n4.  **Styling:**\n    *   Apply the specified color palette to all screens and components.\n    *   Use appropriate typography to enhance the romantic feel of the app.\n\n5.  **Remove Demo Content:**\n    *   Remove the `modalDemos` array from `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` as it's not relevant to the app's purpose.\n\nNow, I will instruct the coding agent to implement the plan and modify the app/(tabs) folder to implement the changes and make the changes visible for the user. After that, the modalDemos array from app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx should be removed.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-11-05T13:08:01.260759"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you create a romantic photo album app!
